# LibrayManagementSystem
In this project we are adding book, remove book, update book and fetch Book. for this project we are using MVC(Model-View-Controller) architecture
 The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components, allowing for better organization and maintenance of code. Here's a brief overview of each component:

Model:
Represents the application's data and business logic.
Manages data and notifies observers (views) about changes.
Independent of the user interface.
Examples in a library management system could include classes for books, users, and transactions.

View:
Displays the data from the model to the user.
Observes changes in the model and updates the user interface accordingly.
Sends user input to the controller.
Examples in a library management system could include the user interface elements, such as displaying a list of books or user information.

Controller:
Handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.
Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, facilitating communication.
Processes user actions and invokes appropriate methods in the model.
Examples in a library management system could include handling the issuance or return of books.
